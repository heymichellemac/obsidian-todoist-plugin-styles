Styles to make the Obsidian Todoist plugin look more like Todoist.

Screenshot of the styles in action:

Note: I am using the [Atom Obsidian Theme](https://github.com/kognise/obsidian-atom) so your mileage may vary if you're using something different.

This repo is intended to give you the matching hex colors that are used in Todoist so you can create a seamless experience between both apps.
